## :hear_no_evil: Why should I like parc? 
 
Parc.js is the \#1 Javascript library 
for beginners to experts. 
No matter how much you know javascript, 
parc.js will be perfect for you. 
Out of _**all**_ Javascript libraries and frameworks, 
parc.js has the _**lowest**_ learning curve. 

## :zap:  Fast implementation 
 
We have optimized our code to be as preformat as possible, 
and you can add it to you project with ease. 

### &lt;/> Implementation through a script tag:
 
```html
<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Leiloukou/parcjs/main/parc.js" type="text/javascript" async></script>
``` 
 
### &lt;/> Implementation through self hosted javascript 
 
 > :warning: **Constant updates**: _Every_ time that parc updates, you _*copy && paste*_ the newest parc.js code. 
 
You can copy the code at the [parc.js](https://github.com/VoltVault/parc.js/blob/pre-release/parc.js) file.
