## 🙉 Why should I even like Porridge? 
 
Porridge.js is the \#1 Javascript library <br /> 
for beginners to experts. <br /> 
No matter how much you know javascript, <br /> 
Porridge.js will be perfect for you. <br /> 
Out of _**all**_ Javascript libraries and frameworks, <br /> 
Porridge.js has the _**lowest**_ learning curve. <br /> 
If you want to be the JavaScript developer <br /> 
that codes faster, more simply, readably, <br /> 
and securely than anyone else on your team; <br /> 
then Porridge.js is the JavaScript library for you! <br /> 
 
## ⚡ Fast implementation 
 
We have optimized our code to be as preformat as possible, <br /> 
and you can add it to you project with ease. <br /> 

### &lt;/> Implementation through a script tag:
 
```html
<script "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voltvault/porridge/main/porridge" type="text/javascript" async></script>
``` 
<br /> 
 
### &lt;/> Implementation through self hosted javascript 
 
 > :warning: **Constant updates**: _Every_ time that Porridge.js updates, you have to _*copy && paste*_ the newest Porridge.js code. 
 
You can copy the code at the [Porridge.js](https://github.com/VoltVault/porridge/blob/main/porridge) file. <br /> 
Or view the raw code at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voltvault/porridge/main/porridge.js.
