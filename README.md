## 🙉 Why should I even like Porridge? 
 
Porridge.js is the \#1 Javascript library <br /> 
for beginners to experts. <br /> 
No matter how much you know javascript, <br /> 
Porridge.js will be perfect for you. <br /> 
Out of _**all**_ Javascript libraries and frameworks, <br /> 
Porridge.js has the _**lowest**_ learning curve. <br /> 
If you want to be the JavaScript developer <br /> 
that codes faster, more simply, readably, <br /> 
and securely than anyone else on your team; <br /> 
then Porridge.js is the JavaScript library for you! <br /> 
 
## ⚡ Fast implementation 
 
We have optimized our code to be as preformat as possible, <br /> 
and you can add it to you project with ease. <br />

### &lt;/> Implementation through a script tag:

Make sure to put it above all other scripts. <br />

```html
<script
	src="https://porridge-cdn.netlify.app/porridge/index.js"
	type="text/javascript"
	async
	defer
></script>
```

<br /> 
 
### &lt;/> Implementation through self hosted javascript 
 
 > :warning: **Constant updates**: _Every_ time that Porridge.js updates, you have to _*copy && paste*_ the newest Porridge.js code. 
 
You can copy the code at the [index.js](https://github.com/VoltVault/porridge/blob/main/porridge/index.js) file. <br /> 
Or view the raw code at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/voltvault/porridge/main/porridge.js.

## 🎓 learning Porridge

If you would like to learn th art of Porridge, <br />
The documentation [lives here](https://porridgejs.netlify.app/docs/) <br />

## 🥐 Everyday uses

Let's look at some real world examples.

### Random filters

First you will include the porridge.js link, <br />
at the top of your head tag. <br />

```html
<script
	src="https://porridge-cdn.netlify.app/porridge/index.js"
	type="text/javascript"
	async
	defer
></script>
```

Next, you will create a function that will <br />
get a random filter from an array of filters. <br />
⚠️ **Note:** Your array of filters can be an array of anything.. <br />

```javascript
// You do not have to have an array of objects,
// you can have an array of anything, including:
//     arrays, strings,
//     numbers, floats,
//     dates, objects,
//     booleans, other variables,
//     and even functions!
const filters = [
	{
		name: 'Pug Face',
		code: 'a91nc49'
	},
	{
		name: 'Flower Crown',
		code: '1nv0ehx'
	},
	{
		name: 'Balloon Head',
		code: 'hq9ch3b'
	},
	{
		name: 'French Fry',
		code: 'qn8e7dc'
	},
	{
		name: 'Stretch-a-Noodle',
		code: '8xhd3jc'
	}
];

let randomFilter;

function generateRandomFilter() {
	randomFilter = porridge.array.rand(filters);

	return randomFilter;
}
```

Make sure to check out the docs to see even more practical usage.
